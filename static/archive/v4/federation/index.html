            <p>The Federation of Intersectional Communities (FIC) is a group of aligned representatives from several different, but intersecting, communities.
              Underneath our Common Values, FIC offers unity and collaboration with other like-minded people to further our shared mission in pursuing these Common Values.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Before reviewing the Common Values, first consider these deliberate intentions and goals of FIC:</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>FIC members come from a variety of communities.
                Often, important and useful work is repeated many times over in different isolated pockets.
                FIC offers community to the friends of communities.
                It is our hope to offer shared wisdom with Member Communities to better enable our shared mission in pursuing our Common Values.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>FIC may act as a shared collective of some resources among Member Communities.
                These could take the form of digital resources, like web infrastructure, or non-digital resources, like workshops, trainings, and/or mentorship.
                Shared resources underneath FIC are intended to be shared equitably among Member Communities in ways that furthers our shared mission in pursuing our Common Values.</p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>There are also a few things that FIC explicitly does <em>not</em> try to be.
              This section is an overview of those things:</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>FIC does not have decision-making in management of Member Communities.
                It is not designed to be a diacritical institution.
                We respect the unique contexts and shared experiences of Member Communities in their local contexts.
                However, if a Member Community takes repeated and/or severe actions that appear to contradict our shared mission in pursuing our Common Values, it may be grounds of removal from FIC membership.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>FIC is a federation and represents many groups and organizations.
                We believe it is the delegation of our Member Communities to pursue policy or engage more visibly.
                FIC aims to be a common forum and shared resource for Member Communities to network and seek support.
                FIC is not intended to be represented as a brand or even a single voice.
                The only thing indisputably shared among all Member Communities is a commitment to our shared mission in pursuing our Common Values.</p>

            <p>The Common Values are the foundation of the Federation of Intersectional Communities.
              All Member Communities are firmly committed to pursuing meaningful work and collaborative contributions to objectives and tasks that align to our Common Values.
              Changes to Common Values are proposed by discussion or Pull/Merge Requests.
              All changes to Common Values require affirmative acknowledgement of all Member Communities.</p>

                Therefore, it is important to value the role of Care in our actions (or non-actions), and in our collaborations.
                We are better able to succeed in realizing our Common Values through our overlapping work when we take care of each other.</p>
